Playing with the github apis using angular

This project does not require a webserver.

To run the tests, clone the project and run

```
npm test  
```

This will install the required dependencies and run the unittest.

```
npm start
```

this will run the project locally. The files from the web directory can be deployed on any webserver to review
the project as well, it does not need node.js.
